/**
 * One VAT regime of the referential: a number, a rate and a label
 * (BO-02-03-14, BO-03-03-04).
 *
 * <p>A table rather than a decimal on every price, because a regime is NAMED
 * before it is a number of percent. The documents the register emits are asked
 * for the VAT NUMBER — the ticket's VAT table and the invoice both state it —
 * and a rate copied onto a hundred thousand price rows cannot be numbered,
 * cannot be relabelled, and cannot be corrected anywhere but in the feed that
 * wrote it.
 *
 * <p>The number is the identity and the upsert key: the commercial management
 * numbers a regime once and every price points at that number. The rate is a
 * FRACTION — {@code 0.0550} for five and a half percent — which is the form
 * every computation in the suite already expects.
 *
 * <p>What this table is NOT: a history. A rate that changes legally is a new
 * value on the same number, and the sold lines are unaffected because a ticket
 * line snapshots the rate at scan time. A ticket reprinted two years later
 * therefore states the rate of its day, not the rate of today.
