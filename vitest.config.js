/*
 * The browser sources under META-INF/resources/admin-assets are plain IIFEs, not ES modules:
 * they wrap everything in `(function () { 'use strict'; ... })();` and export nothing. They
 * are served verbatim to the browser and must stay intact on disk, yet the bench needs to
 * (a) reach their inner functions and (b) have Istanbul instrument them under their real
 * path so branch coverage is attributed to the actual source file.
 *
 * This Vite plugin rewrites each module IN MEMORY only, at import time. For every top-level
 * IIFE it injects, right after the `'use strict'` directive, a capture that copies the
 * IIFE's top-level functions onto a shared `__ui_exports__` object; the file then default-
 * exports that object. The capture sits before the IIFE's boot/return code and references
 * hoisted function declarations, so the functions are exposed even when the IIFE later
 * boots or returns early. The disk file is never touched.
 *
 * The approach is deliberately general so it needs no per-file special-casing:
 *   - multiple IIFEs — each IIFE is matched and captured independently;
 *   - a top-level `return` (sync-refresh.js) — the IIFE stays a function, so `return`
 *     remains legal, unlike a bare unwrap;
 *   - an auto-boot listener — the capture runs before it, so the functions are exposed;
 *     specs keep the boot from throwing by controlling the DOM.
